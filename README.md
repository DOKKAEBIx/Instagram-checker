The Unfollower Finder Tool is a simple Python script that helps you identify users on social media platforms who are not following you back.

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Installation

1. **Download the Script**: Download the `unfollower_finder.py` script from this repository.

2. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install a Text Editor**: Use any text editor of your choice to open and edit the Python script.

### Step 2: Gather Data

1. **Export Followers and Following Lists**: Export your followers and following lists from your social media platform. Save them as text files (`followers.txt` and `following.txt`).

2. **Copy Files to Script Directory**: Copy the `followers.txt` and `following.txt` files into the same directory where you have saved the `unfollower_finder.py` script.

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. **Open Terminal (Command Prompt)**: Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. **Navigate to Script Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the script and text files.

3. **Run the Script**: Type `python unfollower_finder.py` and press Enter to run the script.

### Step 4: View Results

1. **Check Output File**: After the script finishes running, check the `unfollowers.txt` file in the same directory. This file contains a list of users who are not following you back.

2. **Review the List**: Open the `unfollowers.txt` file using a text editor to view the list of unfollowers.

### Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

1. **Remove Sensitive Information**: If you've included sensitive information in your text files, make sure to remove or redact it before sharing or storing them.

2. **Delete Unused Files**: You can delete the `followers.txt` and `following.txt` files after you've finished using the script, or keep them for future reference.

## Compatibility:

- **Operating Systems**: The script should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Browsers**: While the script works well in Chrome, it may encounter issues in Firefox due to differences in JavaScript engine implementations.

## Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter any issues while running the script, make sure you have followed the installation and usage instructions correctly.
- Check for any error messages displayed in the terminal/command prompt and refer to the troubleshooting section of this README.
